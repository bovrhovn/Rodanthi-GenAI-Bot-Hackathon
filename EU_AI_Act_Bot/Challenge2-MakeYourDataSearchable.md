- **Regular Updates**: Ensure that the indexer is scheduled to run regularly to keep the index updated with any changes or additions to the documentation.

By following these steps, you will successfully configure Azure AI Search to make your data searchable, providing your team with the tools they need to efficiently navigate the EU AI Act.
