# Challenge 1: Setting Up a Project in Azure AI Studio

## Introduction
Sofia is embarking on a new project to develop a sophisticated Q&A Bot to help navigate the EU AI Act. After evaluating various platforms, Sofia chose Azure AI Studio for its robust capabilities, enterprise-grade security, and collaborative environment. Azure AI Studio will allow Sofia and her team to efficiently organize their work and build customized AI applications. This is Sofia's first time working with Azure AI Studio, and she is excited to leverage its features for this important project.

## Understanding Azure AI Studio Components
Before diving into the setup, itâ€™s important to understand the key components of Azure AI Studio:

- **Hub**: A Hub in Azure AI Studio serves as a central workspace that provides enterprise-grade security and a collaborative environment. It hosts projects and resources, enabling teams to work together efficiently. A Hub can contain multiple projects.
  
- **Project**: A Project is a specific workspace within a Hub. It is used to organize work related to a particular AI application, saving the state of your work and managing resources such as data, models, and deployment configurations. Projects allow for detailed tracking and management of AI development efforts.
