### EU AI Act Bot Challenge

The EU AI Act is officially out! Your team develops AI systems and needs to comply with all the latest regulations, but new legislation can sometimes be overwhelming. That's why, in this hackathon, you will create a Q&A Bot to assist your team using Azure OpenAI models and Azure AI Search. This bot will help you search through the legislation and understand how to deploy the solution across different channels.

**Challenge Objective:**
Develop a sophisticated chatbot that leverages Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search to provide accurate and relevant information about the EU AI Act. This bot should help your team navigate the complex regulations and ensure compliance with the latest requirements.

**Key Features to Implement:**
- **Comprehensive Search:** Utilize Azure AI Search to index and search through the EU AI Act documentation, providing quick access to specific regulations and guidelines.
- **Azure OpenAI Integration:** Implement Azure OpenAI models to generate precise and contextually relevant answers to user queries about the EU AI Act.
- **Multi-Channel Deployment:** Ensure the bot can be deployed across various channels such as web, mobile, and messaging platforms to provide seamless access for your team.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the bot and retrieve the information they need.
- **Compliance Guidance:** Provide detailed guidance on how to comply with the different risk categories and requirements outlined in the EU AI Act.



Join us in this hackathon to build a powerful tool that helps your team stay ahead in the rapidly evolving landscape of AI regulation. Happy hacking!
